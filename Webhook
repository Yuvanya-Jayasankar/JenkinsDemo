		/*for testing webhook - 🔔 What is a Webhook? (Very simple)
                            A webhook is a way for one application to automatically notify another application when something happens.
👉 Think of it like a doorbell.
You press the bell (event happens)
The bell rings immediately
Someone responds instantly
🧠 Webhook in ONE LINE
                   A webhook is an automatic HTTP message sent from one system to another when an event occurs.
🧩 Real example (your case)
You connected:
GitHub
Jenkins
Event:
➡️ You push code to GitHub
Action:
➡️ GitHub automatically sends a message to Jenkins
Result:
➡️ Jenkins starts a build automatically
That automatic message = Webhook */
